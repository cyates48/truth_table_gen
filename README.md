# truth_table_gen

The truth table generator is a tool that my friend and I thought about because of our Intro to Logic Design course.

The idea is that the user will give a certain amount of letter inputs and boolean expressions (from those inputs). Following this, the code will create the various input combinations in 0's and 1's (2^n combos, where n = # of inputs) and then translate the boolean expressions to either be true or false. 

We are currently in the process of creating the program, but this is what we have so far.
